## TLDR
To compile, you just need a working C++ Compiler, (GNU) Make, and a Linux or Compatible system.  
  
1. `make`  
2. `ln -s "~/.local/share/steam/steamapps/common/Victoria 2" game`  
3. `./bmserver`  
  
This assumes your vic2 install is in `~/.local/share/steam/steamapps/common/` change it accordingly if you have it somewhere else, in steam atleast you can right click vic2 and click browse local files.  

## Support
